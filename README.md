## Description

### Challenge 1 - Time Converter:
Converting a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030")

You will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input.

Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

#### How to run code
- Git clone repo to your local
- Open directory to file location
- Run python3 time_converter.py on your terminal
- Enter the inputs 



### Challenge 2 - Two Positive Numbers:
Your job is to write a function, which takes three integers a, b, and c as arguments, and returns True if exactly two of of the three integers are positive numbers (greater than zero), and False - otherwise.

#### How to run code
- Git clone repo to your local
- Open directory to file location
- Run python3 two_numbers_positive.py on your terminal
- Enter the inputs 


### Challenge 3 - Consonant Value:
Given a lowercase string that has alphabetic characters only and no spaces, return the highest value of consonant substrings. Consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou".We shall assign the following values: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, .... z = 26.

#### How to run code
- Git clone repo to your local
- Open directory to file location
- Run python3 consonant_value.py on your terminal
- Enter the inputs
